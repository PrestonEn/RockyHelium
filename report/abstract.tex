In this study we review the literature surrounding ulnar collateral ligament injury leading to Tommy John surgery. A vast literature review was conducted to outline the issue at hand and possible risk factors involved. A large data collection effort was conducted which resulted in a massive database of interest but no valuable results. We discuss where we went wrong and possible future work.
