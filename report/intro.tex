\section {Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{I}{n} 2014 it was estimated that approximately 10\% of MLB pitchers had undergone Tommy John surgery \cite{Erickson2014}. However, a more recent study (2016) suggests that number has increased dramatically to 25\% \cite{Keller2016}. The sharp increase could be related to better diagnosis criteria and injury data being more readily available. However, regardless of the increase in numbers, the current risk is large with very little known about the risk factors. At a minimum the injury is season ending, but it has the potential to alter pitchers careers and have a financial impact on their teams.
