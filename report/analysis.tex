\section{Analysis}

The average age of pitchers was 30 years old and average FIP scores were similar for index year and year prior as seen in Table \ref{tbl:desc-stats}. None of these variables showed a significant difference in logistic regression.

\begin{tabular}{clll}
     & Means & SD (+/-)  \\
Age  & 30    & 3.8  \\
FIPx & 4.37  & 1.9  \\
FIPy & 4.23  & 1.68
\end{tabular}

Table \ref{tbl:conf-matrix} shows a confusion matrix on the prediction of our random forest. An accuracy of 52.38\% was reported but this was mostly due to the model failing to predict anything as a TJS. The 95\% confidence intervals reported for this accuracy was 0.2978 to 0.7429. This large spread also shows the model was essentially unable to properly classify the data.
