## Outcome of UCL Reconstruction of the Elbow in 1281 Athletes

### Cain Jr. et al., 2010

#### Introduction

anterior bundle of ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) is the primary restraint to valgus stress at the elbow in the functional range of motion between 20 and 120 degrees of flexion

injury to the ucl often leads to symptomatic valgus instability and often requires surgical treatment for return to overhead sports

#### Materials and Methods

1210 baseball players total were included in study

* 32% (386) were professional players (only 86 MLB)
* 48% (583) were collegiate players
* % (240) were high school and recreational athletes

96% of baseball players complained of pain during the late cocking and acceleration phase of throwing

diagnosis of UCL damage was made an average 6.4 mths (0-84 mths) after symptoms began

baseball pitcher styles

* 44% overhand
* 52% 3/4 style
* 4% sidearm

#### Results

75.5% (34/45) MLB players returned to the same level
32% (61/188) minor league players returned to same level
41% (77/188) minor league players moved up to  higher level - 35 (19%) moved up to MLB
1.5% (5/346) collegiate players made it to MLB
19% (66/346) moved up to minor league
67% (233/346) returned to collegiate
83% (118/131) high school returned to same level
6% (8/131) moved on to pro baseball but not MLB

#### Discussion

Principal finding of study: UCL reconstruction allows high percentage (83%) of athletes to return to their previous level of competition

Patient expectations have improved as the surgery has improved. This positive outlook might influence the outcome.

mechanical stability of elbow is provided by both bony and soft tissue restraints.

primary stability to valgus stress is provided by the distal humerus, radis, and ulna - for full extenstion to 20 degrees flexion and and from 120 degrees to full flexion

soft tissue restraints, including the anterior band of the UCL, are responsible for primary stability to valgus stress from 20 degrees to 120 degrees of flexion

baseball pitching generates high valgus and extension forces across the elbow during the late cocking and acceleration phases of throwing. The valgus load produced is thought to approach the ultimate tensile strength of the UCL

throwing elbow encounters repetitive near-failure stresses during high-level sports that could caue microtrauma to the UCL which eventually leads to failure or gradual attenuation. as such, most ucl tears are either an acute injury to a chronically attenuating ligament or an insufficient ligament that produces associated elbow symptoms

attenuation of the ucl may increase stress on restraints which leads to olecranon osteophytes, ulnar nerve neurapraxia, and radiocapiteller chondral damage

based on biomechanical measurements and calculations of the forces generated in the throwing elbow it is surprising UCL failure doesn't occur more frequently

partial tearing of the ucl or attenuation without complete tear is most likely indistinguishable from normal elbow laxity on examination

symptoms can persist for a long time before UCL insufficiency is diagnosed

for athletes in the study who could identify the onset of symptoms, 73% reported onset occuring during the game which suggests a result from overthrowing or fatigue.

analyzing data on pitches thrown during the game and season before injury may help determine a relationship

a higher percentage of return for mlb players than minor league players returned, although it was small - 75% vs 73%.

* this could be due to a higher level of talent and level of determination to return, possibly related to high professional income

several patients progressed to high level of play which indicates not only maintenance of prior performance but possible improvements.

increases in performance are likely related to the result of strength gains during rehabilitation, resolution of long-term symptoms that had hindered performance, or technical or mechanical improvements

the increase in UCL injury and diagnosis is likely related to a combination of factors:

* improved diagnostic techniques
* heightened awareness
* increased chance of positive outcome with current techniques
* overuse of young throwing arms

previous research has reported increased risk of shoulder and elbow pain in youth baseball pitchers (9 to 12 y/o) who throw > 600 pitches in a season (75 pitches/game)

although surgical reconstruction appears to be successful at returning an athlete to their previous level of competition, prevention of injury should be the goal
