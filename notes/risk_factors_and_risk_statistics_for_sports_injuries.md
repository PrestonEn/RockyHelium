## Risk Factors and Risk Statistics for Sports Injuries
#### Hopkins et al. 2007

ex. subject risk factors:

* age
* sex
* skill
* protective equipment
* playing position
* game strategy

ex game risk factors

* level of competition
* playing surface
* weather

statistics for measures of injury incidence

* injury risk
* injury rate
* odds of injury
* injury hazard
* time to injury

effect statistics for differences or ratios of measures quantifies the association between a risk factor and incidence of injury

#### Injury risk

risk in its most specific definition is the proportion of a group with an injury, or the probability of injury for any given individual. it is also generally used to refer to any stat related to incidence of injury.

differences in risk are reported as a single statistic that represents the effect of the risk factor on injury risk - ex. risk difference, risk ratio

risk is the average probability of injury for an athlete

risk generally increases with time - ie. risk of injury over 10 games > risk of injury in a single game. therefore, the time period for each risk should always be stated

risk differences and ratios are good measures when playing and practice times are similar between comparison groups. if one group plays less or more than another, then the risk ratio is misleading - rates are one way to overcome this.

#### Injury rate

injury rate is the number of injuries over a period of time divided by a measure of the total exposure to sport for the period

measure of exposure is athlete-time at risk

    total number of athletes (injured + uninjured) * the avg participation time.
   
expressed as # of practices and/or games or as actual time spent)

games and practices are sometimes added together and referred to as athlete-exposures and injury rates are then expressed per 1000 athlete exposures

incidence density is sometimes used to refer to injury rate

an injury rate indicates how many injuries occur per number of episodes of exposure to sport

advantage of rates over risks: allow for adjustment of differences in exposure to sport between groups

#### Odds of Injury

odds of injury: probability the injury will happen divided by the probability it won't

odds approximate risks only when the risk of injury is low (< 10%)

odds ratio: effect statistic for comparing odds of injury between 2 groups

* also only approzimates the risk ratio when both risks are small (<10%)

odds ratio doesn't mean one group is x times more likely to be injured **wtf does it mean though??**

odds ratios are widely reported in biomedical literature because some statistical procedures are based on analysis of odds

#### Injury Hazard

hazards are rates that are evaluated of a period of time that is so small its basically 0 - ie. the instantaneous risk per unit time. value of hazard changes with the scale of the unit of time

hazard ratio is the instantaneous risk ratio. it approximates the risk ratio only over a small period of time (<10%). as proportions injured increase over longer periods, the risk, hazard, and odds ratios diverge where risk ratio < hazard or rate ratio < odds ratio. by the time almost all athletes are injured the risk ratio would converge on 1.0 and the odds ratio would tend to infinity, but the hazard taio would still be useful

#### Mean Time to Injury

rarely reported, but practical measure of risk for the individual

time can be # of games/practices, clock, or calendar time

if hazard is constant during a period of monitoring then the mean time to injury is just the inverse of the hazard

effect statistics based on time to injury are the difference in mean times and ratio in mean times

the ratio of mean times to injury is simply the hazard ratio. it indicates how many times longer one group of athletes can go until getting injured compared with the another group

#### uncertainty in risk factor statistics

test-based approaches (ie. p-values) are no longer acceptable in epidemiologic studies

it is considered bettwe practice to present sampling uncertainty as confidence interval (usually at the 95% level). confidence interval is a range in which the true value of the effect is likely to be found

it is up to the researchers to decide whether the uncertainty in magnitude of the risk factors provides enough evidence to make the factor important. this needs to take into account the value for the factor that would represent the smallest clinically important increase or decrease in risk. this all depends on how the data are to be used.

confidence interval tells us about the uncertainty or error in a risk statistic due to sampling variation

there are other sources of error not accounted for in confidence intervals

* selection bias: the sample is not representative of the population of interest
* confounding: unknown or unmeasured risk factors

#### estimating risk factors

different procedures are used to calculate confidence limits and estimate contributions of several risk factors

* logistic regression
* poisson regression
* proportional-hazards (cox) regression

the outcome statistic is usually presented for the procedure

* odds ratios for logistic regression
* count ratios or rate ratios for poisson regression
* hazard ratios for proportional hazards regression

odd ratios from properly designed case-control studies are actually statistically equivalent to hazard ratios - conversion of odds ratios to relative risks is not appropriate

injury risk, time to injury, and differences and ratios of these measures of injury incidence are not analyzed directly by the regression procedures

* arguably the best for describing the magnitude of effect of a risk factor and should be estimated via regression procedures

#### risk factors and causality

almost all studies of injury risk factors have a cross-sectional, prospective cohort or case-control design

* these are non-experimental studies and only provide evidence of an association between the factor and risk of injury

#### conclusion

important to transform statistics into numbers that convey magnitudes of risk in meaningful and realistic terms - ex. chances of injury in a season or mean playing time before an injury occurs
