## Performance, Return to Competition, and Reinjury After Tommy John Surgery in Major League Baseball Pitchers
### Makhni et al., 2014

#### Introduction

study had 3 goals:

1. to determine the likelihood of return to MLB competition after TJS in MLB pitchers
2. to determine the likelihood of return to the DL after TJS in MLB pitchers
3. to determine the change in pitching performance after return from TJS in MLB pitchers compared with presurgery performance

#### Methods

Two different online databases were used to identify
pitchers who had undergone UCL reconstruction

* [Baseball Prospectus](http://www.baseballprospectus.com)
* [Baseball Heat Maps](http://www.baseballheatmaps.com)

**_side note: how should players who are injured towards the end of the season be treated?? If the mean time to return is 8mths but that is during the offseason, including them returning a year or more later would skew the results_**

age-matched control cohort of pitchers was identified to make comparisons regarding injury statistics (ie, return to the DL) as well as performance metrics

control pitchers were selected from

* [Baseball Info Solutions](http://www.baseballinfosolutions.com)
* [Retrosheet](http://www.retrosheet.org)

only when players ere placed on DL for injuries to the dominant throwing arm were the considered to be returned to the DL list after surgery

data was collected for 3 seasons of MLB competition before and after surgery

3 comparison scenerios

1. avg performance for each category was compared before and after surgery across all players
2. performance only for the year preceding surgery and the year after surgery was compared
3. performance data from the year preceding surgery were compared with 2nd year after surgery

paired t tests were performed on average performance data comparisons before and after surgery

#### Results

20% failed to return to MLB competition
13% returned only to active status (ie. failed to appear >= 10 games in a single season)
67% returned to established play after surgery

Players who returned took an avg of 16.8 months after surgery

no sig diff in starters vs. relievers, nor age group

before surgery

* 74% of payers went to DL because of injury to throwing arm
* 58% went to DL for elbow releated injuries to throwing arm
* 16% went for non-elbow related injuries to throwing arm

after surgery

* 57% went to DL because of injury to throwing arm
* 26% with elbow injury
* 30% with non elbow injury

controls

* 90% went to DL for any reason related to throwing arm
* 51% went to DL at least once with elbow injury
* reminaing 39% were non-elbow related

no sig. diff was found between groups when considering total # of trips to DL for throwing arm related injuries (elbow and non-elbow related)

a higher proportion of players in TJ cohort went to DL for injuries to the elbow

TABLE 1: Average Performance Before and After Surgery

performance declined in almost every category before and after surgery

TABLE 2: Performance 1 Year Before Surgery Compared With 1 Year After Return

comparing only year before and year after surgery showed delcines in only 3 metrics (% pitches thrown in strike zone, innings pitched, % fastballs thrown)

TABLE 3: Performance 1 Year Before Surgery Compared With 2 Years After Return

comparing year before with 2 years after showed 

* an increased # of pitches, likely associate with the increase in # of innings pitched - however difference was not stat sig.
* declines were found for % of pitches thrown in the strike zone and % fastballs thrown

TABLE 4: Pitching Performance in Tommy John and Control Cohorts

similar changes in performance were seen between groups comparing 3 yrs pre and post index year

* decrease in innings pitched was greater for TJS pitchers (not sig.)

no siff between groups when considering only the first year pre adn post operation

comparing year before and 2nd year after some improvements were seen in TJS group but not seen in controls

* total pitches
* innings pitched
* % pitches thrown in strike zone 

control players showed an improvement in K/9 compared with TJS

for 3 yrs before/after, highest likelihood of decline for TJS was seen in 

* avg pitches per inning
* % of potches thrown in strike zone
* innings pitched
* % fastballs thrown

for 1yr before/after similar declines seen in pitches per innings, % pitches thrown in strike zone, and innings pitched

for 1yr before and 2yrs after there were likely increases noted 

* innings pitched
* total pitches
* fastball velocity

#### Discussion

Surprisingly, the likelihood of designation to the DL for throwing arm injury in the players who ultimately underwent Tommy John surgery (87%) was similar to that in control players (90%). However, there was a significantly higher likelihood of having an elbow injury in the Tommy John cohort (69% vs 51%, P < .001)

although pitchers experienced declines in many performance metrics after surgery, these declines were similar to control pitchersâ€™ declines with similar time frames. Of note, when comparing the second year after return from TJS in the year immediately preceding surgery, certain performance metrics (namely, total pitches) showed improvements compared with data from the year immediately preceding surgery. This finding may indicate a relative drop in performance leading up to TJS that recovers only at the second season after return

when comparing the season before Tommy John surgery with the second season after return from surgery, there was actually an increase in innings pitched in these players, signifying a possible decrease in durability immediately preceding surgery that then recovered in the second season after return from surgery
