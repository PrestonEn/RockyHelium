## Return to Pitching After Tommy John Surgery: Letter to the Editor
### Gray & Cook, 2014

While they are interesting and important to consider, the outcome measures used in previous studies are dependent on variables partially outside of the pitcher’s control - including:

* earned run average [ERA]
* batting average against
* walks plus hits divided by innings pitched [WHIP]
* hits
* runs
* innings pitched
* wins
* losses

These commonly used statistics have been shown to be affected by

* luck
* home ballpark
* league (American vs National)
* team defense
* among other variables

we suggest that these statistics not be used as decisive measures of success or failure of treatments for injured pitchers

Measures of pitching performance that are more independent of the defensive and offensive performance of the pitcher’s team can isolate pitcher-hitter interaction and better assess pitcher function and performance:

* skill-interactive ERA (SIERA)
* fielding-independent pitching (FIP)
* expected FIP (xFIP)

These statistics are based on measures which are largely independent from teammate performance 

* walks
* strikeouts
* home runs
* hit batsmen
* intentional walks

Even more direct measures of pitcher function and performance

* pitch velocity
* movement
* accuracy (location)

With MLB’s PITCHf/x tracking technology (Sportvision Inc), accurate measures of these variables can be determined in a standardized and repeatable manner in all MLB stadiums
