##Rate of Return to Pitching and Performance After TJS in MLB Pitchers

### Erickson et al., 2014

#### Introduction

10% of MLB pitchers have had UCL-R

* article from 2016 says its gone up to ~25% (seriously??!)

purpose of study: to determine

1. rate of return to pitching (RTP) in MLB after UCL-R
2. rate of RTP in either the MLB and minor league combined after UCL reconstruction
3. performance after RTP
4. difference in the RTP rate and performance between pitchers who underwent UCL reconstruction and matched controls w\o UCL injuries

#### Methods

TABLE 1: Demographic and Performance Variables Measured in Cases and Controls

in-game performance variables were analyzed

* as mean values preinjury and post-reconstruction
* separately in each of the first 3 subsequent seasons the player returned to the MLB after the injury as well as the 3 preceding seasons leading up to the injury

controls were matched to cases based on sex, age, BMI, years of experience in MLB, pitching performance in MLB, year of injury, pitching position, and handedness

index year was designated for controls, analagous to the UCL reconstruction year in cases

* ie. controls pitched same number of years before the index year as the cases pitched before surgery

single-variable analyses for all continous variables (performance measures) within groups were performed using paired-sample Student t-tests for normally distributed data

one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-for-fit tests for Gaussian data distribution were performed and confirmed the normality of all data

the number of wins, losses, complete games, shutouts, and saves were normalized to the number of games played per season

strikeouts, walks, hits given up, runs given up, and home runs given up were normalized to the number of innings pitched per season

linear regression was used to determine if there was a significant increase in the incidence of UCL tears per year

#### Results

TABLE 2: Comparison of Data Before UCL Reconstruction (Cases) Versus Before Index Year (Controls)

the length of career in MLB after UCL reconstruction was 3.9 +/- 2.84 yrs

there was no sig. diff between cases and controls before surgery or the index year in any performance variable

TABLE 3: Performance Comparison Before and After UCL Reconstruction (Cases)

TABLE 4: Performance Comparison Before and After Index Year (Controls)

TABLE 5: Comparison of Data After UCL Reconstruction (Cases) Versus After Index Year (Controls)
#### Discussion

RTP rate for MLB pitchers back to MLB was 83% (97% to pro baseball)

fewer wins and losses after UCL reconstruction could be explained by the fewer innings pitched - MLB requires min. 5 innings pitched to earn decision

annual revenue of professional baseball was $7.7 billion in 2012

in 2012 389 pitchers in the MLB had salaries ranging from $480k to $23,145,011

* 35 pitchers made $10M+
* 82 pitchers made $5M+
* 216 pitchers made at least $1M

there are no data to support or even consider prophylactic UCL reconstruction to improve throwing velocity or prevent injuries in the future
