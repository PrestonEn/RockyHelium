## Analysis of Pitching Velocity in Major League Baseball Players Before and After Ulnar Collateral Ligament Reconstruction
### Jiang et al., 2014

#### Introduction

primary objective: assess the mean velocity of pitches thrown by MLB pitchers before and after UCL-R

secondary objective: evaluate common performance statistics pre- and post-injury

#### Methods

index year = year of injury

mean velocity for fastball, changeup, curveball, slider was calculated for each year (if pitch was part of repetoire)

stats compared:

* total innings pitched
* ERA
* batting average against pitcher
* walks per 9 innings (BB/9)
* strikeouts per 9 innings
* WHIP

an active MLB pitcher with the most similar career stats befor the index year was selected as a pair-matched control for each pitcher in the study group

* selection was determined by algorithm on baseball-reference.com
* no controls had a history of UCL, but no exclusion was made on other types of injuries

mean percentage change in velocity was compared between groups for each season and pitch type

commonly measured baseball performance statistics were also compared between the 2 groups of pitchers

a priori power analysis showed that 15 players were needed in each group to detect 1% difference in the mean change velocity between the 2 groups

* statistical power of 80% with an alpha = 0.05
* based on 2007 and 2008 mean fastball velocity and SD of 0.8mph in the difference in mean velocity

All data from preinjury and postinjury years were com-
pared with those from the index year for each eligible pitcher by using the paired t test

mean percentage change in velocity of the study group was compared with the mean percentage change in velocity of the control group using a paired t test

independent 2-sample t test was used to compare performance statistics including mean innings pitched, ERA, BAA, BB/9, K/9, and WHIP

#### Results

TABLE 2: Mean Pitch Velocity and Mean Change in Velocity Compared With the Index Year for the Study Group

a small but statistically significant decrease in fastball and changeup velocities for each postinjury year in the study group. 

Curveball velocity decreased in postinjury years 2 and 3. There was a statistically significant difference in the changeup velocity for the preinjury year and a trend toward significance for curveballs

no difference for change in velocity for sliders thrown in any year

no statistically significant differences in any season for any of the pitch types between groups

between groups, there was a statistically significant difference in the number of innings pitched for the index year and first postinjury year. There were no significant differences in all other years compared

mean ERA between the study group and control group showed no statistical difference for each year

mean BAA, BB/9, and K/9 were not different between the 2 groups for each year

#### Discussion

results showed small, statistically significant, decreases in the velocity of fastballs, changeups, and curveballs thrown by the pitchers after surgery. 

* mean changes in velocity were not different when compared with controls

no statistical differences were identified with respect to common baseball outcome measurements between our study group and pair-matched control group

BAA and ERA in the 2 groups represent no difference in the pitchersâ€™ effectiveness of limiting opposing teams from obtaining hits and runs

BB/9 represents no difference with overall control of pitches thrown

K/9 represents the comparable likelihood of opposing batters in missing contact with the pitches thrown

combined measurement of pitch control and effectiveness in limiting hits, as measured by WHIP, did show a statistical trend toward poorer performance in only the index year of the study group

reduced participation in the index season can be attributed to the season-ending nature of the injury, and the reduced participation in the first postinjury year can be attributed to the long rehabilitation after UCL reconstruction

* mean innings pitched were similar at 2 and 3 years after surgery

study was powered to only identify differences in the mean velocity of fastballs thrown. It was not specifically powered to identify for differences in commonly used statistical outcome measurements. Thus, while our data appear to show no difference in ERA, BAA, BB/9, K/9, and WHIP, it is possible that alargersamplesizeisneeded to achieveamore definitive conclusion
